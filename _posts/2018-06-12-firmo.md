## Token metrics
unknown

## Market opportunity/Competitive analysis
- No existing market leader in the formally verified smart contract language space
- No existing market leader in the decentralized derivatives space
- Competitors include [dYdX](https://dydx.exchange/) (launches in spring 2019) and [Market Protocol](https://marketprotocol.io/), both of which run on Ethereum only.
- Firmo's extensible compiler means a single Firmo contract can be deployed onto various chains.
- Firmo supports derivatives with full, variable, and zero collateral coverage. unlike Market Protocol.
- Market Protocol supports a collateral pool consisting of ERC20 tokens, and all settlement will be done with these tokens rather than the underlying asset. This means Market Protocol supports non-crypto assets as long as there is an oracle updating the asset's price.
- dYdX supports fully covered options as well (but details on collateral are light in the whitepaper)
- dYdX works with 0x to immediately work with several exchanges.
- Difficult to write complex and bug-free code
- Competitors only work on single blockchains
- Firmo's formally verified [domain specific language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language)(DSL) is mathematically proven to be bug free. It's not turing-complete and each feature is proven.

## Competitive Advantage
- 2 years of work already
- TODO

## Tokenomics and Token Utility
- Firmo tokens are sent to Firmo when code is run through the compiler.
- Firmo tokens can be used as collateral in the derivatives smart contract. I have some concerns here regarding Firmo token volatility, considering it will fluctuate against the reference asset. The Firmo team is aware of this and is actively discussing potential solutions, as of 06/12/18.
- Section 9.0 in the whitepaper says they are currently writing a full chapter on the FRM token model. In my call (06/12/18), the team said they would update me with their token model within 2 weeks.

## Code
Firmo was kind enough to share their private code with me over a video call. I was impressed, based on the 10+ repos I saw - and the team walked me through each one proving that they had spent at least 2 years on this project. While I can't go into specifics until they release the code publicly, here is an overview of what already exists:

- compiler
  - simplistic design, but does the job. Optimizations possible but since this is a non-turing-complete DSL this is fine)
- prototype compiler
  - Oh hi Haskell.
- formal proofs for compiler, written in [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/)
  - Written by the 2 compiler specialists on the team. Not my expertise, but the code I saw looked clean and understandable. And there was a LOT of code.
- ERC-20 smart contract for FRM token
- website frontend, in React
  - Nice and clean. Tests included (great sign)
- beta website for users to try the Firmo compiler
  - Nice and clean. Tests included (great sign)
- demo website for users to see example use-cases of the Firmo protocol
- demo website backend
- telegram bot service to manage spam and welcome new users
- dYdX fork
  - Competitive analysis is great to see!

Many of the compiler commits were done by https://github.com/shrewbi. He has a compiler repo in his account from 2015 that looks like a university project.

TODO - more team member github analysis!
