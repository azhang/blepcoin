XAIN is a access control protocol and public permissioned blockchain with a novel consensus method called "Partial Proof of Kernel Work". Users get full access control over their machine and device permissions. For example, smart cars connected to the blockchain can share their data with authorized data consumers.

Use cases: GDPR, medical data, smart car data, IoT data.

*Disclosure: I am an advisor for Unification, which doesn't directly compete but has some common overlapping features.*

## Token metrics

- $6MM equity

- $2MM SAFT

## Market opportunity/Competitive analysis

#### Launched:

**[Atonomi](https://atonomi.io/)**: Atonomi has a bigger scope than XAIN. Some of the features that Atonomi differentiates themselves from XAIN is identity validation and device reputation.

0.11x USD, 0.33x ETH, 0.13x BTC (source: https://icodrops.com/atonomi/)

**[DML](https://decentralizedml.com/)**: DML has a slightly different focus (decentralized machine learning with user generated data)

0.05x USD, 0.15x ETH, 0.07x BTC (source: https://icodrops.com/dml/)

#### Not launched yet:

**[Beyond Protocol](https://beyond.link)**: Beyond Protocol is an IoT communication protocol. The Beyond Protocol pitch deck does not go into tokenomics or data access control. I'm not a fan of the [pitch deck](https://docsend.com/view/upvdx52) at all - too many buzzwords and does not talk about a legitimate problem or a solution.

**[Unification](https://unification.com/)**: Unification provides a protocol to connect and monetize existing databases on blockchain. Unification includes a permissioning protocol.

21 total team members as of an May 2018 pitch deck.

XAIN won the "Porsche Innovation Contest", a blockchain startup competition.

Partnerships with NVIDIA and Daimler.

XAIN also has partnerships with several other German automakers under NDA.

## Competitive Advantage
As a German company, they have a local advantage to developing with all the German automakers. 

XAIN has good progress on the FROST compiler, which puts **their access control system significantly ahead** (in terms of technology and capability) of their competitors. 

The launched competitors did very poorly in their ICOs, which shows these potential insights: 

1. the competitors will not have the resources to compete, or 
2. investors are not yet ready for a company in this category.

## Tokenomics and Token Utility
If XAIN decides to stick only with their PPoKW blockchain, then the token makes sense. New nodes without a built-up reputation have to hold tokens as collateral.

If XAIN decides to be a layer 2 protocol on another blockchain, then it would have a medium of exchange with no/weak [sink](https://vitalik.ca/general/2017/10/17/moe.html). During a call with the team, they mentioned they want to "deploy first then decide on tokenomics." The tokenomics has to be more compelling than just a medium of exchange, or else they can just use Ethereum.

## Code

#### [go-ethereum](https://github.com/xainag/go-ethereum) fork

![xain-geth]({{site.base_url}}/images/xain1.png)

This repository has not been updated since Feb 21th 2018. The team's explanation as to why there has not been much recent progress is that this was made specifically for the Porsche pilot. However it seems like a significant part of the project in the whitepaper and the paper describing PPoKW.
The code changes in this repository since the fork are the implementation of "Practical Proof of Kernel Work" ([PPoKW](https://medium.com/xain-technical-stories/explaining-xain-and-partial-proof-of-kernel-work-ppokw-d02df42b4a4f)), "an energy-optimized consensus algorithm that works in ECUs of the cars."

I did not see any red flags in the design of PPoKW. Essentially, each round selects a committee of random nodes to reach consensus. The nodes that qualify are those with a high reputation, or have staked tokens (in other words, the nodes hold reputation and/or tokens as collateral). And the random selection of nodes is based on a Verifiable Random Function. There may be issues if reputable nodes collude to exit-scam the network.

#### Frost compiler (Private)

The majority of recent work has been on this, a compiler to describe access control. The code was skimmed through through a video call and looks good. Most engineers are not able to write a compiler, so this shows the engineering talent they have on the team.

**This is interesting because even though some other projects have access control implementations, this is one of the few projects (if not only) that implements a [domain specific language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language) for more complex logic, such as changing permissions based on a certain time-frame.**

#### Embedded C client

This code runs on low power IoT devices. According to the team, it's been in progress since June/July 2018. The code was not shared since they were under NDA for some partnerships, but since it's just a client, it's not super critical for this review.


## Conclusion
XAIN has smart team members who have experience in their target market and have secured some name-brand partnerships. However, the project seems fairly early on the crypto market side and early investors should prepare to help a lot. The project has a good basis but advice on the ICO, tokenomics, and biz dev side can make it significantly better.

The project is lacking some focus in some areas, and focus too much on other areas. For example, they are semi-working on a consensus mechanism while also working on a protocol that doesn't directly need it except in low power cases.

The FROST language provides an edge for this project. I can imagine countless use cases where permissions and access control are not static.

"Deploy first then decide tokenomics" is a red flag response.

## Other Info

In this [blog post](https://medium.com/@XAIN/part-1-technical-overview-of-the-porsche-xain-vehicle-network-f70bb117be16), XAIN says that "one of the main technological features of XAIN is its consensus mechanism PPoKW." It seems somewhat worrying that there has been no progress in that repo for 8 months.

The access control protocol does not rely on a specific consensus mechanism.
