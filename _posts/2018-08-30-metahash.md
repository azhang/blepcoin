 #MetaHash is a network for sharing digital assets and a dapp platform, claiming the following features:

- validation rate under 3 seconds
- 50000 tps
- 5 different consensus algorithms
- decentralized
- supports erc20 tokens

There are 4 components of the system.

1. TraceChain: the blockchain
2. #MetaApps: Decentralized applications
3. #MetaGate: Wallet + dApp directory
4. #MetaHashCoin: the coin

## Token metrics


## Market opportunity/Competitive analysis

There are countless other projects competing in dapp platform space. However, Ethereum is still the biggest and has the network effects. 

> #MetaHash block anchors in Bitcoin and Ethereum networks

I don't see many other projects offering this.

## Team/Advisors/Partnerships

> #MetaHash is an open-team structured project, which welcomes all people and companies.

> More than 150 members already joined #MetaHash

## Competitive Advantage
 #MetaHash has several teams, a total of 150 people, working on this project.

## Tokenomics and Token Utility

#### Forging

> - 50% of all #MetaHashCoins will be distributed over 10 years by forging. That is exactly 4,600,000,000 #MHC.
> - 708,400,000 #MHC (or 15.4% of the total forging pool of all time, or 7.7% of the #MHC total number) will be distributed among the forging participants within the first year after the start. The fewer coins are used in forging, the higher rewards for the participants.
> - 70,840,000 #MHC (or 10% of the reward from the forging pool) will go to those who have #MetaGate active and at least 100 #MHC in their wallet. If you don’t have much money, the best way for you to earn #MHC is to use #MetaGate every day (by launching it on your computer).
> - 637,560,000 #MHC (or 90% of the reward from the forging pool) will go to those who have 100,000 #MHC and more in their wallets.

#### Other

CPU time, data storage, data transmission.

## Code

 #MetaHash has 2 github accounts, 1 public and 1 private.

#### Private account:

Unfortunately, I'm unable to share any insights from the repo metadata since it looks like there is no git history. 

With that said, there is a substantial amount of well-organized code, all in C++.

![image-20180830164140664]({{site.baseurl}}/images/metahash1.png)

The private account has 4 repos. You may notice that the names of all the repos except meta-node-proxy correspond with node types in the network.

![img](https://static.metahash.org/img/graphical/speeds-grafical.jpg)

----

**[meta-node-proxy](https://github.com/MetaHashPrivate/meta-node-proxy)** (446 lines):  an http server that validates and queues transactions for the verification nodes, and logs metrics. 

----

**[meta-node-torrent](https://github.com/MetaHashPrivate/meta-node-torrent)** (28 C++ files, 6904 lines): Saves blockchain to leveldb. Torrent nodes transmit data between the wallet and other nodes.

(list of meta-node-torrent source files with line counts for each file)

​	Starting at `main.cpp`: It reads the config file, sets up statistics reporting, starts a LevelDB instance, and starts synchronizing everything. Finally, it starts the server thread:

![image-20180830175849276]({{site.baseurl}}/images/metahash2.png)

I wasn't able to find the Sniper library that this uses, as shown in `Server.h`,

    ```cpp
    #include <sniper/mhd/MHD.h>
    # ...
    class Server: public sniper::mhd::MHD {
      # ...
    }
    ```

but there is still a good amount of info we can gather from `Server.cpp`. It implements the following functions callable through http (defined below the code in this screenshot but private for now):

Other files of note in this repo include `P2P*` (handling the peer to peer communication and pushing transactions to a queue) and `synchronize_blockchain.cpp` (reading from the tx queue and synchronizing with a local LevelDb cache and cdn). These 2 files form what #MetaHash calls **#MetaSync**.

> **#MetaSync** data synchronization subsystem allows complete and integral data updating around the world in under 3 seconds

**[meta-node-verif](https://github.com/MetaHashPrivate/meta-node-verif)** (1 C++ file, 305 lines): 

`main.cpp` runs an http server that reads and process transactions.

#### Public repo:

https://github.com/metahashorg

**[#Metagate](https://github.com/metahashorg/metagate)**: #MetaHash wallet code

476 commits. There is a lot of code here but wallet/client code isn't as interesting or critical as node code. This repo was started on [May 20, 2018](https://github.com/metahashorg/metagate/graphs/contributors) but the [first commit](https://github.com/metahashorg/metagate/commit/58002f9c00bcce5ad979ce58caf4e84a67e0f4b3) shows there was work from before existing git history. Git history shows that the team is making active progress in this repo.

## Conclusion

The blockchain has substantial code behind it, all written from scratch (not a fork of anything else). #MetaApps are not ready yet as far as I can tell, and the way it's explained it seems more like a decentralized cloud than a smart contract platform.

One of the biggest differentiating factors #MetaHash claims is that it is faster and more decentralized, while still maintaining security. I would love to see if #MetaHash published a test set-up and report to prove these numbers, because otherwise this is a very difficult space to compete in.

 #MetaHash says that it uses block anchors in the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks to increase security; however, I was not able to find the implementation in code.

Another differentiating factor is #MetaApps, which #MetaHash claims can run with using any programming language. To me, it sounds like it plays a different role than smart contracts, but the team uses them interchangably. Due to this, I'm not sure if #MetaHash should be categorized as a dapp platform as opposed to a decentralized cloud platform.
