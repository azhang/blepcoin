Metadium is a project focused on solving one of the oracle problems in blockchain: **identity**. With a Proof of Authority consensus, Metadium uses a set number of accredited nodes to verify the relationship between a physical identity and virtual identity.

Metadium is a product by [Coinplug](https://www.coinplug.com/), which was founded in Oct 2013.

Coinplug "provides bitcoin exchange, wallet, okBitcard and payment processor services targeting Korea and the Asian market."

## Market opportunity

#### Identity on blockchain

"Identity on blockchain" is a bottleneck, preventing a whole category of dapps from being made. In the non-blockchain world, consider how widespread a few [oauth2](https://oauth.net/2/) providers are; Oauth2 is the reason why you can login to 3rd party websites using your Google/Facebook/Twitter credentials. There is no standard for blockchain yet.

#### Solving sybil attacks

[Sybil attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack) are attacks "wherein a [reputation system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reputation_system) is subverted by forging identities in [peer-to-peer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_to_peer) [networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network)." Consider any polling or voting website - you can usually vote as many times as you want. For slightly more sophisticated systems, you might need to clear your cookies, change your IP address, or register a few more Facebook accounts. How do you design a secure system to prevent this?

For non-blockchain, solutions already exist. All that services need to do is cross reference their data with data at *centralized* entities, which serve as identity authorities; for example, government organizations and credit agencies.

For dapps, the solution is much more difficult to achieve. Being on decentralized networks, relying on a centralized oracle creates an unacceptable security risk. A decentralized network cannot easily be reset/reverted if a centralized system it depends on is compromised.

## Competitive analysis

- **[Sovrin](https://sovrin.org/)**: The Sovrin Foundation has [many large companies](https://sovrin.org/stewards/) running validator nodes already, including law firms, crypto ecosystems, security firms, and financial firms. In addition, [Microsoft publicly presented Sovrin tech being integrated into their Authenticator app](https://outlierventures.io/microsoft-announces-sovrin-partnership/).  The Sovrin codebase is open-source and part of the [Hyperledger Foundation](https://www.hyperledger.org/).

#### Partnerships

- Technology Partner (Coinplug)
- Unity

## Competitive Advantage

As a blockchain company that has been around since 2013, Coinplug has already dealt with many of the growing pains other ICOs need to go through. The engineering team is already sizeable, and their advisors include some of the most well known people in crypto. The roster suggests that Metadium will have strong pre and post-ICO support.

The Unity partnership is very interesting because it means Metadium's go to market strategy is more on the consumer market, unlike Sovrin, which is focusing on the enterprise market.

## Tokenomics and Token Utility

META tokens are used as transaction fees, as part of every on-chain activity. These fees go to the nodes, aka block producers.

**Block Producers (Nodes)** are rewarded for producing blocks and securing the network.

Tokens are also spent for the attestation service: when **users** want to link or update identity data on the network.

**Service Proivders** reward users with META in return for using the identity data.

## Code

As of 08-14-2018...

There is a private repo along with a public repo hosted on Github. Here is an overview of both:

**Private repo**:

![image-20180814184614176]({{site.baseurl}}/images/metadium1.png)

- **MetadiumIdentityManager.sol**: Create/Update/Restore/Delete MetaIDs, with a couple other utility functions. Uses the MetadiumNameService.sol to determine who has permission to create MetaIDs.
- **MetaID.sol**: A simple [ERC721](http://erc721.org/) token for each person
- **MetadiumNameService.sol**: A mapping of contracts and permissions. Early, barebones smart contract.
- **Migrations.sol**: Included in Truffle



**Public repo: https://github.com/METADIUM/go-metadium**

35 commits ahead of ethereum/go-ethereum

Let's look at [changes since the fork from geth](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/compare/master...METADIUM:master).

- **[cmd/geth/main.go](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/compare/master...METADIUM:master#diff-37def8a8c5ffccd7af569d23609a15ba)**: Starting here, it looks like additional flags have been added to the starting geth, including options for consensus method, metadium abi, fixed difficulty, fixed gas limit, max idle block, and blocks per turn. This also starts the metadium Admin.
- **[metadium/admin.go](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/compare/master...METADIUM:master#diff-573372fa53f905d0b9c24e293e9bd9ed)**: This file provides a golang wrapper for the admin smart contracts. A lot of `callContract()` calls, utility functions, and data structure wrangling.
- **[metadium/contracts/MetadiumAdmin-template.sol](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/compare/master...METADIUM:master#diff-c69b7910eba2a444d250d91a31f1ec8c)**: Admin contract for Metadium. It currently has the functionality to retrieve member info (`getMember`), retrieve node info (`getNode`), add member (`memberLinkAppend`), add node (`nodeLinkAppend`), and some other helper functions around members and nodes.

**The above files are the core files for metadium admin in the go-metadium repo**. The following are additional minor changes

- **[cmd/geth/metadiumcmd.go](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/compare/master...METADIUM:master#diff-bd5cec6cd9f7925a20436c690aebb950)**: Implementation of the Metadium command line tool, to [create new account](https://github.com/METADIUM/go-metadium/blob/e73296ef0516a62c8921748049984c3775527055/cmd/geth/metadiumcmd.go#L133), [create new node](https://github.com/METADIUM/go-metadium/blob/e73296ef0516a62c8921748049984c3775527055/cmd/geth/metadiumcmd.go#L167), [load a genesis config](https://github.com/METADIUM/go-metadium/blob/e73296ef0516a62c8921748049984c3775527055/cmd/geth/metadiumcmd.go#L204), and [generate an admin contract](https://github.com/METADIUM/go-metadium/blob/e73296ef0516a62c8921748049984c3775527055/cmd/geth/metadiumcmd.go#L287).

- **[miner/worker.go](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/compare/master...METADIUM:master#diff-83814d75e37ea3b4eb16ffc7202295d3)**: The only addition is to not create a new block if there's no work to do. 
- **[node/api.go](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/compare/master...METADIUM:master#diff-9333767b602263d799081cc2b59fa874)**: Added `PeerInfo` and `MetadiumInfo`, to provide info in the api.

## Conclusion

#### What is done:

- Some core components of a Proof of Concept have been written: smart contracts for managing MetaIDs, permissions, admin functions, along with a fork of geth that adds support for the Metadium admin and admin smart contract. 
- This project is at the stage where "self-sovereign ID creation service flow" (below image) is within reach. 

![img]({{site.baseurl}}/images/metadium2.png)

#### What isn't done yet:

- Providers still need a way to store hashed sensitive identity data on the blockchain, in a way that's consumable by other entities using Metadium. This part might be tricky.
- Permissions: MetadiumNameService.sol needs to be fleshed out with more permissions.
- The attestation part of the project is not done yet.

Metadium has the core technical parts necessary to start fulfilling some use cases, where Agency attestation is not yet necessary. However, there is still some work to be done in order to get full functionality as described in the whitepaper.

I'm looking forward to see who participates as a Proof of Authority node, and which partnerships Metadium brings on, as they play a significant role in this project.
