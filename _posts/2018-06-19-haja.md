Currently building OrbitDB, "a scalable and trustless peer-to-peer database, and database protocols for a global data layer to re-decentralize the web."

## Token metrics
Not public

## Market opportunity/Competitive analysis
Hard to tell at this stage.

## Team/Advisors/Partnerships
- [Samuli P√∂yht√§ri](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuli/): CEO, software engineer background
- [Vesa-Ville Piiroinen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vesa-ville-piiroinen-5b6b14/) ([twitter](https://twitter.com/vvpiiroinen)): CTO, software engineer background

- [Juuso R√§s√§nen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juusorasanen/): Biz Dev

- [Eden Dhaliwal](<https://www.linkedin.com/in/edendhaliwal/>), Board Director, tokenomics
  - MBA at Univ. of Toronto; examines token economies and business models of web 3.0 and convergence (blockchain + AI, IoT, etc) companies for investment as partner at Outlier Ventures

- [Outlier Ventures](https://outlierventures.io/)
- [Polychain Capital](http://polychain.capital/)
- [BigchainDB](https://bigchaindb.com/)
- [Creathor Ventures](http://www.creathor.com/)

## Competitive Advantage
Hard to tell at this stage since it's pre-tokenomics

## Tokenomics and Token Utility
- N/A (Seed round, no tokenomics)

## Code

[![github stats]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/haja0.png)](https://github.com/orbitdb/orbit-db)
806 commits, 1198 stars, 114 forks, 141 issues, 243 pull requests. ü§©! Probably the most active git repo I've seen in crypto in a long time.

[![github issues]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/haja1.png)](https://github.com/orbitdb/orbit-db/issues)
All the open issues on Github seem to be from active users of the project. The frequency of new issues is pretty high, and all the issues older than 2 weeks ago have productive discussion. Clearly a very active project with a large dev community.

[![github contributors]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/haja2.png)](https://github.com/orbitdb/orbit-db/graphs/contributors)

There are 239 closed / 4 open pull requests. Let's see who's making all these updates.
I missed this earlier, but this repo was started in Dec 20, 2015, and it's been consistently active throughout it's lifetime. 
[Haad](https://github.com/haadcode) and [Friedel Ziegelmayer](https://github.com/dignifiedquire) are the major contributors. 
**Notably**, [Friedel is the #2 most productive contributor to the Karma project](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma/graphs/contributors), one of the most popular Javascript testing tools available. **Additionally**, he's in the top 3 contributors for [js-ipfs](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs), the Javascript implementation of the IPFS protocol, also with significant active users.

- Note: neither Haad nor Ziegelmayer are listed as team members on Linkedin.
- Project has [continuous integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) [set up](https://circleci.com/gh/orbitdb/orbit-db), running these [tests](https://github.com/orbitdb/orbit-db/tree/master/test). They look fairly comprehensive, testing replication and stress. This shows that this isn't some project that was just hacked together.
- Because this project has genuine community support/usage and solid experience indicators already (eg. the proven contributors, the comprehensive testing, the [comprehensive](https://github.com/orbitdb/orbit-db/blob/master/API.md) [READMEs](https://github.com/orbitdb/orbit-db/blob/master/README.md)), a deeper dive into the code has diminishing returns on the usefulness of this evaluation. 

### Team members githubs
- I couldn't find any official team member contributions to open-source projects. Hopefully Haad and Friedel Ziegelmayer (mentioned above) are on the team / will join the team full time!
