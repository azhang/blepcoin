[![github stats](images/haja0.png)](https://github.com/orbitdb/orbit-db)
806 commits, 1198 stars, 114 forks, 141 issues, 243 pull requests. ü§©! Probably the most active git repo I've seen in crypto in a long time.

[![github issues](images/haja1.png)](https://github.com/orbitdb/orbit-db/issues)
All the open issues on Github seem to be from active users of the project. The frequency of new issues is pretty high, and all the issues older than 2 weeks ago have productive discussion. Clearly a very active project with a large dev community.

[![github contributors](images/haja2.png)](https://github.com/orbitdb/orbit-db/graphs/contributors)
There are 239 closed / 4 open pull requests. Let's see who's making all these updates.
I missed this earlier, but this repo was started in Dec 20, 2015, and it's been consistently active throughout it's lifetime. 
[Haad](https://github.com/haadcode) and [Friedel Ziegelmayer](https://github.com/dignifiedquire) are the major contributors. 
**Notably**, [Friedel is the #2 most productive contributor to the Karma project](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma/graphs/contributors), one of the most popular Javascript testing tools available. **Additionally**, he's in the top 3 contributors for [js-ipfs](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs), the Javascript implementation of the IPFS protocol, also with significant active users.

- Note: neither Haad nor Ziegelmayer are listed as team members on Linkedin.
- Project has [continuous integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) [set up](https://circleci.com/gh/orbitdb/orbit-db), running these [tests](https://github.com/orbitdb/orbit-db/tree/master/test). They look fairly comprehensive, testing replication and stress. This shows that this isn't some project that was just hacked together.
- Because this project has genuine community support/usage and solid experience indicators already (eg. the proven contributors, the comprehensive testing, the [comprehensive](https://github.com/orbitdb/orbit-db/blob/master/API.md) [READMEs](https://github.com/orbitdb/orbit-db/blob/master/README.md)), a deeper dive into the code has diminishing returns on the usefulness of this evaluation.
